Born and raised in Canada, Piper received both her undergraduate (BAS) and graduate (M.Arch) degrees at the University of Waterloo's School of Architecture. She is the recipient of the Canada Council for the Arts' Prix de Rome for Emerging Practitioners, the Canadian Governor Generals Academic Gold Medal, and the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada's (RAIC) Medal for her work and research.</p><p>In recent years, Piper has worked extensively on international exhibitions on law, evidence, and architecture, working as a logistics coordinator, project manager, and artifact/archive administrator, always interested in the role exhibitions play in making accessible architectural work, design, and theory to a broader audience. Of note, Piper was the logistics manager of the University of Waterloo's submission to the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale, The Evidence Room which reconstructs key objects and artifacts used in the forensic analysis of the architecture of Auschwitz. Piper has also worked as a manager for “Auschwitz: Not Long Ago, Not Far Away” (Madrid), “Waterloo in Venice” (Cambridge), and has had work featured in several exhibitions including Nuit Blanche (Toronto), Come Up to My Room (Toronto), The Lightroom Gallery (Ottawa), and The Riverside Gallery (Cambridge). In addition, her research has been featured in international publications, and she has lectured extensively about her work. </p><p>Piper's research is focused on the intersection of law and architecture, the considerations and constraints of social and spatial plurality, and the appropriation of space through design. She is interested in the potentials found between empathy and design, narrative and fictions, and spaces of inclusivity and plurality. Generally, she seeks to understand counter-narratives to spaces, and invests time in exploring “otherness” in terms of spatial belonging, history and understanding.</p>","suzanne-bio":"<p>Suzanne Harris-Brandts is Assistant Professor of Architecture and Urbanism at Carleton University. She is also a licensed architect and co-founder of the design-research practice Collective Domain. Harris-Brandts holds a PhD in Urban Studies from MIT and a Master of Architecture from the University of Waterloo.

Tom Avermaete, Leandro Medrano, Luiz Recamán, New York: Routledge, 2021. </p>","karen-bio":"<p>An assistant professor of landscape architecture at the University of Minnesota and director of the Great Lakes Design Labs. Her design research focuses on how landscape architects and designers might better design 'with' changing landscapes and non-human entities. This work includes the development of the design approach, 'Curious Methods', and a particular emphasis on quick littoral landscapes and slow-growing trees. Karen's work can be found in Places Journal, Scenario Journal, LUNCH, MinnLab, as well as others and you can find out more about her ongoing projects, publications, and collaborations at the Great Lakes Design Labs website (www.gldl.org) She holds an undergraduate degree in “Environment and Society” from Brandeis University and a Master of Landscape Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>","lisa-bio":"<p>I make paintings, models, buildings, installations and instruments that question how architecture constructs environments in light of climate breakdown. I am an Associate Professor in Architecture at Carleton University, and I run a design practice, Studio Moffitt. Previously, I was a tenured academic at the University of Edinburgh, where I also completed a PhD Architecture by Design.</p><p>My work takes three primary forms. First, I prototype experimentation devices such as wind tunnels, water tables, and filling tanks for use as speculative design tools. Second, I design projects that utilise light-touch passive design principles, conceiving of buildings and landscapes as environmental instruments. Third, I situate contemporary environmental design concerns within a broader historic context. I have written about the legacies of Étienne-Jules Marey's wind tunnels, Victor and Aladár Olgyay's thermoheliodon, and David Boswell Reid's ventilation experiments in relation to building climate control, flow visualization, and thermal comfort concerns today.</p><p>My work has been published in Dwell Magazine, Architectural Research Quarterly, Architecture and Culture, Landscape Research, Journal of Landscape Architecture, and Technology | Architecture + Design. My forthcoming book, Architecture's Model Environments (UCL Press, Design Research in Architecture series), explores the capacity for physical models to reveal architectural environmental concerns across scales, from the instrument that leaks, to the body that feels, to the building that mediates, to the atmosphere that immerses. </p>","marc-bio":"<p>Marc Swackhamer's research practice, HouMinn, is a partnership with Blair Satterfield from the University of British Columbia. Their work challenges broadly accepted approaches to design agency through focus on interdisciplinary partnerships, unconventional making, material misuse, and the role of decay in architecture. HouMinn has won national design awards from Architect Magazine, ID Magazine, and Core77. Marc's interdisciplinary design collaborative, MinnLab, won the Minneapolis “Creative City Challenge” and a Minnesota American Society of Landscape Architects Deign Award. With Blaine Brownell, from the University of North Carolina Charlotte, he co-authored the book Hypernatural: Architecture's New Relationship with Nature. Marc recently launched an interdisciplinary design research laboratory at the University of Colorado Denver called LoDo Lab. He is Chair of the Architecture Department and Professor. He studied at the University of Cincinnati and Rice University.</p>","robert-bio":"<p>Robert Jan van Pelt has taught at the University of Waterloo School of Architecture since 1987 and held appointments at many institutions of higher education in Europe, Asia and  North America. He is the recipient of many academic honors, including the National Jewish Book Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the dignity of “University Professor.” He has published thirteen books dealing with diverse topics such as the cosmic speculations on the Temple of Solomon, relativism in architectural history, the history of the Holocaust and its denial, and most recently, An Atlas of Jewish Space, which accompanied the opening in 2021 of a new synagogue at the site of the Babyn Yar massacre in Kyiv. He appeared in Errol Morris's film on the holocaust denier Fred A. Leuchter, Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr (1999) and served as an expert witness for the defense in the notorious libel case Irving vs. Penguin and Lipstadt (1998-2001). His forensic work on the crematoria of Auschwitz generated The Evidence Room installation, shown first at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale, in 2017 at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and in 2019 at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C. Van Pelt is the Chief Curator of the international traveling exhibition Auschwitz. Not Far Away. Not Long Ago which opened in Madrid in 2017, in New York in 2019, and in Kansas City, in 2021 This exhibition, organized by Musealia in collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and other major Holocaust museums, includes over 650 artifacts. It will travel to 10 other global cities in the next seven years.</p>","susanna-bio":"<p>Susanna Hohmann has 17 years of hands-on experience at Terrazign, managing all aspects of studio operation and production. She concentrates on material research and development, focusing on textiles (wovens and knits), narrow goods, and foams that meet specific functional needs on each unique project. Terrazign is a design consultancy that specializes in textiles and textile integration with hard goods and other structural components. The firm utilizes machines and materials, especially textiles, in unconventional ways to solve radically diverse problem sets. Clients range from Nike to NASA and everyone in between. Terrazign's approach is simple: design by prototype, work with real materials immediately,  and iterate to gain knowledge from quick tests that provide insight and reveal new design opportunities. Extra to Terrazign, Susanna has contributed to built architectural prototypes with HouMinn Practice, and her work with fabrics has been exhibited widely, including shows at the Weisman Art Museum (Minneapolis), the Pratt Manhattan Gallery, the Edge Gallery in Chicago. Susanna's work has been published in Architect Magazine and ID Magazine. She also contributed case studies to Helene Renard's book Felt: The Soft Revolution (2015, Princeton Architectural Press). Prior to Terrazign, Susanna was Research Associate in a lab focused on the molecular genetics of obesity. She also holds her Master of Architecture from Rice University and a BA in Biological Science from Smith College.</p>"}}},
