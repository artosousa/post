Born and raised in Canada, Piper received both her undergraduate (BAS) and graduate (M.Arch) degrees at the University of Waterloo's School of Architecture. She is the recipient of the Canada Council for the Arts' Prix de Rome for Emerging Practitioners, the Canadian Governor Generals Academic Gold Medal, and the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada's (RAIC) Medal for her work and research.</p><p>In recent years, Piper has worked extensively on international exhibitions on law, evidence, and architecture, working as a logistics coordinator, project manager, and artifact/archive administrator, always interested in the role exhibitions play in making accessible architectural work, design, and theory to a broader audience. Of note, Piper was the logistics manager of the University of Waterloo's submission to the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale, The Evidence Room which reconstructs key objects and artifacts used in the forensic analysis of the architecture of Auschwitz. Piper has also worked as a manager for “Auschwitz: Not Long Ago, Not Far Away” (Madrid), “Waterloo in Venice” (Cambridge), and has had work featured in several exhibitions including Nuit Blanche (Toronto), Come Up to My Room (Toronto), The Lightroom Gallery (Ottawa), and The Riverside Gallery (Cambridge). In addition, her research has been featured in international publications, and she has lectured extensively about her work. </p><p>Piper's research is focused on the intersection of law and architecture, the considerations and constraints of social and spatial plurality, and the appropriation of space through design. She is interested in the potentials found between empathy and design, narrative and fictions, and spaces of inclusivity and plurality. Generally, she seeks to understand counter-narratives to spaces, and invests time in exploring “otherness” in terms of spatial belonging, history and understanding.</p>","suzanne-title":"Pavilion Project Management Co-Lead","suzanne-bio":"<p>Suzanne Harris-Brandts is Assistant Professor of Architecture and Urbanism at Carleton University. She is also a licensed architect and co-founder of the design-research practice Collective Domain. Harris-Brandts holds a PhD in Urban Studies from MIT and a Master of Architecture from the University of Waterloo. Her research brings together design and the social sciences to explore issues of power, equity, and collective identity in the built environment, often foregrounding the role of designer agency. Suzanne's work has been widely disseminated in books, journals, design publications, public lectures, and exhibitions. It has been generously supported by the Graham Foundation, SSHRC, Aga Khan Foundation, National Science Foundation of Georgia, and Open Society Foundation. In 2013, she was awarded the RAIC's Student Medal and was shortlisted for the Canada Council for the Arts' Prix de Rome for Emerging Practitioners. Harris-Brandts has over a decade of experience at international design-research practices, including extensive project management and curatorial work. In 2010 and 2011, she was an Architect-in-Residence with DA/AR in the West Bank investigating the design implications of de-facto political boundaries at the community level. The work included several international multi-media exhibitions. Suzanne's own research then built on these themes and was subsequently being featured in her exhibition, Landscapes of Resistance. While a core team member at Toronto-based Lateral Office, Suzanne acted as deputy curator for Arctic Adaptations, Canada's selection for the 2014 Venice Architecture Biennale, which received the jury's Special Mention. The project then toured five galleries across Canada with Suzanne as a project manager. Harris-Brandts was also a primary design-researcher for Lateral Office's book “Many Norths: Spatial Practice in a Polar Territory” (Actar, 2017). More recently, she led Wooden Mosques, a two-year research initiative exploring the endangered architectural legacy of Muslim communities in Georgia's mountainous Adjara region, culminating in a travelling exhibition, online interactive platform, and open-source publication. In 2020, Collective Domain was selected to participate in the Tbilisi Architecture Biennial.</p>","blair-title":"Pavilion Exhibition Design Co-Lead","blair-bio":"<p>Blair Satterfield is Associate Professor and Chair of Architecture at UBC SALA where he lectures and teaches design studios in both the graduate and undergraduate programs.

Prior to teaching, she worked professionally at a number of renowned offices including, Vincent James Architects Associates in Minneapolis, Howeler and Yoon Architecture in Boston, and Barkow Leibinger Architects in Berlin. During this period, she gained extensive experience in hands-on fabrication as well as project management and coordination of projects ranging in scale from installations to interior fit-outs and ground-up construction. Her curatorial experience has developed primarily through the design and curation of public spaces and experiences where relationships are expressed through material practice and making. This is most readily seen in the projects, “Aviary”, “UNI Storefront Library”, “Light Drift”, and “Thicket” where public experience and embodiment is specifically tuned to spatial cues within each installation. More recently, Thena has also founded the design practice LILO (Little Office) which privileges alternative ways of seeing and thinking. The practice considers stories of entanglement, slowness, and reciprocity through the weaving of architecture, land, and art. She holds a Master of Architecture from Harvard University Graduate School of Design with Distinction and a Bachelor of Architecture from Cornell University Architecture, Art and Planning.</p>","support-title":"Hilo/YOW+ Support Team","partners-title":"Our Partners"}}},
